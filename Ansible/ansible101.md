# Ansible 

Ansible is an automation engine that allows for agentless system configuration and deployment.

- Ansible is a tool that can execute tasks on remote or local systems that does not require any additional software outside of the ansible software installed on one server.

- Ansible operates over SSH and runs ansible modules on remote systems in order to complete the requested task.

- Ansible is typically installed on a single, lightweight control node where a list of host inventory files, as well as "playbooks", are kept. 

- The heavy lifting is generally performed on the remote hosts as that is where the ansible modules are executed.
