Centralized location to share study group notes. 

## 2019

* **February**- [Yaml Essentials](https://github.com/JupiterBroadcasting/CommunityNotes/tree/master/yaml_essentials)

## Planning 

- [In-Person Events](https://github.com/JupiterBroadcasting/CommunityNotes/tree/master/in_person_events) 
Centralized location for notes taken at events we attend. 

- [security](https://github.com/JupiterBroadcasting/CommunityNotes/tree/master/security) 
You all asked for us to focus study groups around security so Ell has decided to prepare by taking the Security+ exam and she's sharing her notes along the way.
