### Remembering that you know your stuff

* Come prepared (which you probably already are!! )
* Don't be afraid to say "I don't know" - its better to say I don't know openly than to try to sell your ignorance.
* Buddy up
  - Use terms like "to expland on X idea." "X that's a great idea, to add to it" "On X point"
  - Nix I think out of your vocabulary  

### Your style of assertivness

* No good or bad style of assertiveness- there is your style and you need to find it
* Real talk: women stuggle with being percived as too strong or not strong enough - whats right?
  - There is room in the middle- find it and Own it 
  - Make sure your voice is heard- challenege your self not to sit silently in the corner. This can be a tricky goal for those who are introverted; practice makes perfect.

### Confidence

* Amy Cuddy's Ted talk - [Your Body Language shapes who you are]()
  *You need to be consious of your pose and your body language*
  - Take up space!
  - Power Pose- The "Super Man Pose"
  - The high power pose
  - The low power pose

 - "You are intimidating" "Your sargent is coming out." "Know your place." - **Do you really want to be there ?**



## Male allies

Ben Peavy- Accenture
Don't look for someone who's just like you, look for someone who i going to push you out of your comfort zone or question you. 

Charles Beierle - RBFCU
You have to find someone who has juice. You have to be careful in who you ask to be your mentor. 
Advocate your self and do it with facts and your metrics.

Rebecca Weaver - RBFCU
We need to be allies for anyone that is being rolled over not just allies of women.

Question from the audiance: "As allies how you do handle it when someones makes a "not okay" comment. Where people see thigns from more of a human prespective.
"That moment"- Dont make the assumtion that individual will be able to stand up for themselves. How many people have been in that position? over half of the room raised their hand. 

How do you heal your self? How do you find your strength again?

## Advacning your career in tech (?)

Deborah Carter <> - Bexar County
**What's the vision for San Antonio when it comes to the tech sector?** 
    Embrace and grow the Houston Tech corridor, some what centered around the Rand building. Also Port San Antonio and Brook City Base , we are number 2 in cyber secuirty but are on the path to change that.

**How is tech playing a part of Bexar county?** (missed quesiton but as best as I could remember)
Goal is to create high paying jobs in to San Antonio, advanced manufacturing (Toyota), IT and Cyber Security by sharing the ways that Bexar county can make it easier for them to transition to San Antonio. Through all of that the talent is a huge piece of the puzzle. Cast Tech high school, the new Cyber Security campus that San Antonio is building.

*Audiance participation: "How is Bexar County inticing us to stay."*
 By bringing in oppertinuites that would encourage them to stay. Bringing in companies with high wages that can encourage people to look for employment here.

Dax Moreno Chief Talent Officer- SA Tech Block
    San Antonio's talent is changing the focus of where we are growing. For example advanced manufacuring around robotics is happening in port san antonio. Virtual relaity and augmented reality is slowly springing up in our area.

*How can we encourgae women to get involved in our tech community*
It's about our stories, its about what we show and tell. How are we helping push the message and promote the positive stories. Celebrate each others wins and no longer looking at it as bragging. If people don't talk about it and say what they want there is no way for us know.

Whats the visibility to see working professionals in that field. How can you activiate your self in to your community. Showing up matters. There is a big push about social media "influencers" and this becomes the only aspect of what success is. There is no real working professional examples. 

**How is San Antonio keeping their edge compared to other cities when it comes to tech talent.**
    Playing to our strengths and telling stories. We are good at the first but not at the second. We are humble people who is community based and end up creating isolated enviroments. The RBFCU campus, the castle, but we need to be able to tink about the bigger picture. Many communities are getting "over it" with what has happened to their communities. 

Sean Attwood Senior Director of <> - SAWorks
    Bringing people together through not just technology but also to open spaces.

**How are the changes in Tech impacting San Antonio.**
     Main stream cloud adoption. Tech thats increasing now is folks who understand the holistic approach of intigrating legacy technology and cloud or those who understand the migration of the tech. 
We are one of the most social econimic seperated cities in the US. Transportation issues that allow us to be able to tranverse the city. It's not about women its about people, it's about providing oppertunities to everyone.


p16 badging system that reflects the understanding of a skill pushing to have us focus on the same skills from soft to hard skills. The idea of gamification to help people know where their strengths are. How do you bring in the concepts of "strenghts" in to elmentry schools? 


## Work life balance

Kerrie Eppinger RBFCU cyber security  - look for flexibility with the oppertunity to work remote. 
**Technolgies that allow for work life balance** Using your phone both a curse and a blessing
**So when do you put it down, when you step away**
**How did you get to your role**
