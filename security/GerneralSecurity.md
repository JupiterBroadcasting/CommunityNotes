## Terms:

* Black box testing- Pentester has little to no knowledge of the system it's self. 

* White box testing- all the functionalities of the system are known to the pen tester. 

* steganography 
    - Steganos: "covered, concealed or protected."
    - Graphein: " Writing." 

* Honeypot is a server designed to look and act like a real server but rather than having real data the data within it is fake.
	- legal concerns of the use of a honeypot is entratment.
    

## Security Tools: 

###  Passive tools- listen to gain info
* Protocol analyzer - capturing network traffic to be able to view traffic patterns (ie wire shark)
    - Can be used on wired or wireless to view traffic patterns and identify unknown or unverified traffic and verify network tools. 

### Active tools - send traffic to the target to gain information 

 - Can be used on wired or wireless to view traffic patterns and identify unknown or unverified traffic and verify network tools. 

* Network Scanner- a tool designed to probe a network or system for open ports. You can have it scan a specific IP or a range of IP addresses.

* Wireless scanners- there are specially crafted tools to perform wireless scanning because of these differences many organizations often neglect to ensure compliance of their wireless network.

### Vulnerability Scanners

* Network vulnerability scanner
* Host vulnerability scanner
* Application vulnerability scanners 
* Configuration compliance scanner- security content automation protocol (SCAP) was developed for automating config checks. These scanners are used to inform admins when their configuration does not meet their defined requirements. They check for
    - os versions
    - installed programs and apps
    - settings  of the network
    - presence and settings of anti-virus

### Vulnerability scanning results
* Plan of Action
    - what measures are taken when the results are found and how do we shore up and put controls in place to address vulnerabilities found. 

### Exploitation Frameworks
are tools that attackers use to find vulnerabilities in a system (Metasploit)
