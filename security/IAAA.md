- ***Authentication***  is the process of verifying that identity
    - What you are (biometrics)
    - What you have (tokens)
    - What you know (passwords, security questions)
    - where you are (location)

- ***Authorization***  is the process of permitting or denying access to a resource based on identity. 

- A users identification enables authentication and authorization to form the basis for ***accountability*** through maintaining logs, we are able to determine who accessed what resource and when based on user ID. 

## other

- **Single sign-on (SSO)**

- **Federation** -means linking a users identity across multiple distinct systems across different enterprises. 

- **Transitive trust**- authentication through multiple domains is provided through trust relationships. Each domain has its own authentication mechanism, and if a domain trusts another domain, then it trus its authentication as well.
