# Malware
A Piece of software designed for something nefarious. 

## Polymorphic Malware

Has the ability to change its code after each use. 

## Virus

Pieces of malicious code that replicates by attaching itself to another piece of executable code. 
* Armored Virus: most viruses found are dissected by reverse engineering to understand what they are doing, where they come from, ect. Armored viruses aim to stop those efforts usually via encryption.

## Randsome ware

encrypts files through automated means, which the attacker then uses to demand ransom in exchange for encryption keys. 

* crypto-malware: the early beginning of handsome ware, this type of attack aims to create a DoS by encrypting files.

## Worms

malware that, once it's in on a network, can traverse and spread independently. Where a virus relies on some other piece of code to execute on its own.

## Rootkit

Form of malware designed specifically to modify operations of the operating system to facilitate nonstandard functionality.

## Trojan 

A program that charades with one characteristic or functionality (and may perform that functionality,) but it has another nefarious purpose. 

- Spyware: malware that spies on user activity and reports stolen information.  One might look at keyloggers as a version of spyware. 

- Keylogger: Software that logs every keystroke of an end user.  Occasionally attackers will install this as a trojan to allow them to collect user information. 

- Bots: A piece of Software that performs tasks under the control of another program. 

- Remote Access Trojan (RAT) toolkit designed to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system.

## Logic Bomb

Deliberately installed piece of software that sits dormant until some event triggers its malicious payload.

## Backdoor

After gaining unauthorized access to a system, some attackers will install what's known as a backdoor. This is just a means to ensure that they can regain entry.
