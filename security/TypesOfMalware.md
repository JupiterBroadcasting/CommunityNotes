# Malware
A Piece of software designed for something nefarious. 

## Polymorphic Malware

Has the ability to change its code after each use. 

## Virus

Pieces of malicious code that replicates by attaching itself to another piece of executable code. 
* Armored Virus: most viruses found are dissected by reverse engineering to understand what they are doing, where they come from, ect. Armored viruses aim to stop those efforts usually via encryption.

## Ransomeware

encrypts files through automated means, which the attacker then uses to demand ransom in exchange for encryption keys. 

* crypto-malware: the early beginning of handsome ware, this type of attack aims to create a DoS by encrypting files.

## Worms

malware that, once it's in on a network, can traverse and spread independently. Where a virus relies on some other piece of code to execute on its own.

## Rootkit

Form of malware designed specifically to modify operations of the operating system to facilitate nonstandard functionality.

## Trojan 

A program that charades with one characteristic or functionality (and may perform that functionality,) but it has another nefarious purpose. 

- Spyware: malware that spies on user activity and reports stolen information.  One might look at keyloggers as a version of spyware. 

- Keylogger: Software that logs every keystroke of an end user.  Occasionally attackers will install this as a trojan to allow them to collect user information. 

- Bots: A piece of Software that performs tasks under the control of another program. 
    - botnets are roboto networks that are usually installed through the use of a trojan hourse. Once they are installed they await for a command from a central location. They could be used to DDOS a network and some attackers are making money by time sharing the bots. 

- Remote Access Trojan (RAT) also known as Remote Admin Tools (RATS) is toolkit designed to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system.
    -IE The Dark Rat 

## Logic Bomb

Deliberately installed piece of software that sits dormant until some event triggers its malicious payload.
- Logic bombs will await a predefined event that may be a date or a user-defined event. 
 
    - One such case occurred on March 19, 2013, in south kora where all boot records from banks were deleted and the computers were rebooted meaning computers no longer able to boot an OS. The bomb was sent via a hotlink an email. 
 In order to prevent such attacks, there needs to be a set process and procedures in place for companies along with auditing. In addition one might configure alerting configured to mark changes on a system. 

## Backdoor

After gaining unauthorized access to a system, some attackers will install what's known as a backdoor. This is just a means to ensure that they can regain entry.
